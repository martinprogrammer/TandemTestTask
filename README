This is a .Net 4.5 solution built in VS2013 that consists of
1) Web Api
2) Business layer - class lib
3) Data access layer - class lib
4) Domain entities - class lib

I used Unity IoC & NUnit
I didn't use any authentication / authorisation - I'm simply letting all userIds go through
I only did basic unit tests for the data repository
No error handling 
No async
